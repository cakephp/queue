This is a Queue system for CakePHP.

The plugin consists of a CakePHP shell wrapper and Queueing libraries for the [php-queue](https://php-enqueue.github.io) queue library.

## Installation

You can install this plugin into your CakePHP application using [Composer](https://getcomposer.org).

Run the following command
```sh
composer require cakephp/queue
 ```

Install the transport you wish to use. For a list of available transports, see [this page](https://php-enqueue.github.io/transport). The example below is for pure-php redis:

```shell
composer require enqueue/redis predis/predis:^1
```

## Configuration

You can load the plugin using the shell command:

```
bin/cake plugin load Cake/Queue
```

Or you can manually add the loading statement in the **src/Application.php** file of your application:
```php
public function bootstrap(): void
{
    parent::bootstrap();
    $this->addPlugin('Cake/Queue');
}
```

Additionally, you will need to configure the ``default`` queue configuration in your **config/app.php** file.

## Documentation

Full documentation of the plugin can be found on the [CakePHP Cookbook](https://book.cakephp.org/queue/1/).
